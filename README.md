# ImageEncrypt-Decrypt

Image Encryption and Decryption using AES Algorithm:

* This project implements image encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. 
* AES ensures secure transmission of images between sender and receiver by converting plain images into encrypted images and vice versa.

AES Algorithm:

* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for its robust encryption capabilities.
 The key used for encryption is the same key used for decryption.
* AES supports variable key lengths, providing options for 128, 192, or 256 bits.

Security Measures:

* A password strength checker is integrated to ensure users employ strong passwords.

Implementation:

* Developed as a Python script.
* Executed on Kali Linux.
